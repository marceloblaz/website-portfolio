          <p class="body2 xpdescription">
            Caixa Econômica is one of the biggest banks in Brazil, if not the
            biggest. I'm proud of having worked on several apps, most
            prominently Caixa Tem, with over 170M downloads that financially
            helped Brazilian people get through the 2020 COVID pandemic. I
            worked with a team of 9 other designers to build various of Caixa's
            apps, webpages, and internal systems.

	<p class="project-info">One of the most popular ways of making payments in Brazil is the so called boleto. It's a
		bank slip with a barcode that can be scanned in order to make the payment. Normally they must be paid cash, so
		that's where pagboletos comes in: their proposition value is allowing users to pay the boleto with their credit,
		which gives the user more time to pay for their debt.</p>
